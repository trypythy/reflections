When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A remote repository would make sense(and perhaps the logical option) when one is not on his local system!
also to collaborate with others and get their contributions to my repository, it would help if they could
push it to the remote repository.
----

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

cause i decide when I want to pull changes. If someone updated the remote with a commit that I do not want(or may not want or the commit may be faulty), I would not want that to happen without my knowledge.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Fork: when you want to use someone's repo on github and build over it(add/remove stuff)
Clone: when you want to clone a repo. Fork is also a clone but fork allows you to make changes and you would fork when you do not have the permission to add code in a repo.
Branches: when you want to add a feature or experiment with stuff ona particular repo.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

to gauge what changes have happened since you synced with the repo.
----

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

now that we know about services like git, it would be hard to collaborate without it. Everything would be easier with git, except maybe things for which one would have to wait for a collaborator to update/merge before things can be taken live.
----

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

seperate branch should be used when you want to experiment with a new feature and want to check with other collaborators - without disturbing the master branch. When changes in branch are fine, one can merge it into the master. This ensures master branch always is bug free.
working directly on master branch saves a lot of extra work / complications but is not really safe - I won't feel safe!
