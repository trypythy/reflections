What happens when you initialize a repository?
Why do you need to do it?

to create a git repository so that it starts
tracking the changes that are made to the 
files & diretories.

How is the staging area different from the 
working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

it is a temporary location for whatever
commits one is wanting to make in a go.
It helps add several files, directories
and then commit. Need to word it better!
