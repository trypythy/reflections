What happens when you initialize a repository?
Why do you need to do it?

to create a git repository so that it starts
tracking the changes that are made to the 
files & diretories.
----

How is the staging area different from the 
working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

it is a temporary location for whatever
commits one is wanting to make in a go.
It helps add several files, directories
and then commit. Need to word it better!
----

How can you use the staging area to make sure
you have one commit per logical change?

perhaps by adding only one change at a time!
----

What are some situations when branches would 
be helpful in keeping your history organized?
How would branches help?

branches allow you to branch out without
affecting the code - specially useful when
you want to experiment with something while
keeping the main code unaffected or rather
want to add features to master and also 
experiment with a branch!

'git branch' shows the available branches
'git branch <new branchName> would create a
new branch.
'git checkout branchName' would move to the
mentioned branchName
